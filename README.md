# 📚 Online Bookstore SQL Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates SQL skills through the design and analysis of an **Online Bookstore Database**.  
It includes three main tables — **Books**, **Customers**, and **Orders** — and performs various SQL queries to extract meaningful insights such as customer purchasing behavior, book sales performance, and overall revenue generation.

All data is imported from CSV files and queried using SQL commands.
